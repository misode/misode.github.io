1. Go to the [Spyglassmc localization website](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/projects/) (hosted by [SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding)).
2. [Register](https://l10n.spgoding.com/accounts/register) by linking your GitHub account (recommended), or using your email.
    - Note that the username and email will be shown in the [repository](https://github.com/misode/misode.github.io)'s git commit log.
3. See the components of misode.github.io [here](https://weblate.spyglassmc.com/projects/misode-github-io/web-app/).
4. Start translating!

## Modded Generators
This website contains a few [non-vanilla generators](https://misode.github.io/predicate/). It is possible to contribute additional generators. If instead you are interested in making custom generators but don't want them part of the main website, see the [forking section](#forking) below.

1. Create a new file `public/mcdoc/<your_project>.mcdoc`. This will contain the definitions of the
2. Create a new generator entry in the `src/app/config.json` file for each generator page that you want to add. Set its `dependency` field to the name of the mcdoc file you created.
3. Add translation key for each generator in `src/locales/en.json`, named `generator.<id>`, and a translation key named `partner.<dependency>`.
4. The final step will be to write the generator definitions in the mcdoc file. Apart from the [technical specification](https://spyglassmc.com/user/mcdoc/), there is no documentation for the mcdoc format. It is a custom language describing JSON and NBT structures in the game. I recommend taking a look at how the other modded generators have their types. You can also look at the [vanilla mcdoc definitions](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vanilla-mcdoc).
5. Feel free to open a PR even when you are not ready with the types, or if you want help with writing them.

## Forking
You are allowed to fork this repository and use its base as a way to publish your own generator site, but I ask to make a few changes before publishing.

1. Change links to this repo to your own repo. This can be done at the top of `Utils.ts` by changing `export const SOURCE_REPO_URL = ...`.
2. Remove or replace the Google Analytics tracking code in the root `index.html` file. To avoid breaking the rest of the website, you can replace everything between the `<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->` markers with this:
```html
<script>
    function gtag() {}
</script>
```
3. Disable the ads, first by remove two lines in `index.html`:
```html
<script async src="https://media.ethicalads.io/media/client/ethicalads.min.js"></script>
...
<div data-ea-publisher="misode-github-io" data-ea-manual="true" id="ad-placeholder"></div>
```
4. Secondly, you can remove the ad component, for example by returning `<></>` in `Ad.tsx`, or by removing the `{!gen.tags?.includes('partners') && <Ad id="data-pack-generator" type="text" />}` line in `SchemaGenerator.tsx`.
5. Remove the contributors and giscus comment section on the homepage. You can do this easily by removing `<Contributors />` and `<Giscus />` in `Home.tsx`.
6. Make some other changes to the home page. This will depend on what you need, but you might want to remove stuff like `<WhatsNew />` and/or `<Tools />`.
7. Edit the `Footer.tsx` component. You can remove the donation link, but I would appreciate if you still kept a note that your fork is based on my work, for example by linking to my github profile or this repository.
8. Change some of the translations in `src/locales/en.json`. Particularly you might want to change the `title.home` key.
